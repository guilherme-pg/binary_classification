## Recognition of the Maracatu type



<p>The Maracatu is a combination of dance, musical rhythm and ritual of religious syncretism.</p>
<p>It is a cultural manifestation of Afro-Brazilian origin coming from the State of Pernambuco (Brazil), in which the conservation of this tradition predominates.</p>
<p>Maracatu is divided into two types (two beats): Maracatu Nação (Baque Virado) and Maracatu Rural (Baque Solto).</p>

<p>While the first is characterized by an association between percussion and a royal African procession practiced more frequently in the metropolitan regions of the State, the second is related to a rural tradition that links folklore with a game played by rural workers, involving, in addition to the essence of african elements, traditions from the Portuguese and indigenous peoples.</p>

<p>This project aims to create an algorithm that receives an image and responds if it is maracatu nation, rural maracatu or not maracatu.</p>
